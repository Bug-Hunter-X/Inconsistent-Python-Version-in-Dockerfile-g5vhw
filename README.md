This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dockerfiles: inconsistent Python version usage when relying on the base image's package manager. The initial Dockerfile lacks version pinning for Python 3, potentially resulting in different Python versions during builds across various environments and times. The solution shows how to specify a precise Python version to ensure reproducibility.
